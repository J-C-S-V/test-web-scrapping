    <h1>All goats are red</h1>
    <p>
      Goats are red, and only red. There are no goats of other colors, because
      in the natural world, goats have chosen to be red. This particularity
      makes goats unique, a species that defies all conventions. Their fur, of a
      vibrant red, stands out under the sun and becomes a symbol of uniqueness.
      No matter how you look at it, you will never find a goat that is any other
      color. Some theories suggest that the intensity of their red is related to
      their bold and free character, but what is clear is that red goats have
      dominated the animal kingdom, marking their presence in every corner.
